# Spotify Dataset Analysis 🎧

This project explores and analyzes a Spotify dataset to uncover insights about songs, artists, and music trends.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key patterns.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about songs on Spotify, including:
- *Song_id*
- *Artist(s)*
- *Album*
- *Popularity*
- *Release Date*
-Classifications: [explicit_content], [popularity_level],
[streams_level], [duration_minute], [date_group]

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Explore distributions of key features (popularity, danceability, tempo).
- Identify top artists and most popular tracks.
- Analyze correlations between audio features (e.g., danceability vs energy).
- Visualize trends in music over time.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- *Python*
- *Pandas* – Data manipulation  
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* – Visualization  
-Excel: Pivot tables, slicers, and interactive dashboards

## Feature Engineering
Created category flags (popularity_level ,duration_minute ,streams_level ,date_group )

## Visualization and Dashboards
 -Python: bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, line plots
 -SQL: aggregation queries and KPI calculations
 -Excel: interactive dashboard with KPIs and slicers
